Hey Foodies, Who ever said making Lasagna is a tedious process and time consuming…I guess they are right, but i would also like to say that once you see this video you at least won’t fret and make an honest attempt. The uniqueness of this recipe is absolutely nothing is store bought even the lasagna sheets are homemade. Learn the trick and technique to make the pasta sheets, make soft dough with simple staple with flour, salt and oil. Make the filling with fresh vegetables and Italian spices. Assemble the lasagna with layers of marinara and white sauce, pasta sheets and veggie and loads of cheese. Cook until the lasagna is soft from inside and crispy and cheesy from the outside.
